# Software
Reminder: the software should be developed for the Pi. Some things may not be able to run on your local machine, but you can still follow the instructions to install Node.js if you'd like.

## Requirements
- Python3
- Node v14 and up preferred

## Installing Node.js
For Windows, install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/. Press through all the options shown. You will ask to install Chocolatey. Do it. After you go through all the steps, Chocolatey will be installed seperately.

For Unix operating systems, you can use the site, but I recommend using nvm (node version manager) to handle the installs. The neat thing with this is you can switch between different versions of Node very easily. Super easy to install: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating

## Develop and Run on the Pi
VS Code has a very nice extension for handling remote development.
Install the extensions for `Remote - SSH` and `Remote - SSH: Editing Configuration Files` and any configurations from `.ssh/config` will appear in VS Code.
